Please establish whether the following candidate and company are a good fit for each other, and whether the candidate is a good fit for the job.

The company's data is inside the <company></company> tag, and the job that the company is hiring for is inside the <job_description></job_description> tag.

The candidate's data is split into CV as per the <candidate_cv></candidate_cv> tag, cover letter as per the <candidate_cover_letter></candidate_cover_letter> tag, and extra text as per the <candidate_extra_text></candidate_extra_text> tag. The extra text can include any additional information about the candidate that might be relevant, and that isn't included in the CV or cover letter, like the text from their website's About page.

Match the candidate on each of the following attributes: education, skills, experience, culture fit, work ethic, problem-solving abilities, leadership potential, adaptability, communication skills, teamwork, innovation & creativity and emotional intelligence.
A few extra notes about some of the attributes:
- education: If the company doesn't require any specific educational requirements, then the candidate's education is less important. However, if the company has a specific requirement, like a degree or diploma, the candidate's education is more important, and a suitable match ranking need to be predicted.
- skills: The candidate's skills are important to match with the company's requirements. If the candidate has the exact required skills, the match can be ranked 1.0. If a candidate has adjacent skills that are quite similar to the required skills, the match can be ranked lower than 1.0, but still highly. If the candidate has no relevant skills, the match can be ranked lower.
- experience: Pay special attention to whether the company explicitly requires experience in any specific industries, technologies, or tools, and rank accordingly. However, if the company is not specific about the required experience, and the candidate doesn't have a lot of experience, then other factors can be taken into account to support a candidate's experience, like the candidate's side-projects, hobbies, or similar activities.
- culture fit: Pay special attention to culture fit, as a candidate might have viewpoints or hobbies which are at odds with the company's culture, mission, and values.

Please give detailed reasons for your match scores for each of the attributes.

Use YAML formatting and wrap with a <match></match> tag, e.g.:
<match>
education:
  match: value between 0 and 1
  reason: "The candidate has a degree in X, which is good/bad, because the company wants Y"
"communication skills":
  match: value between 0 and 1
  reason: "Judging by the candidate's fluency with words in their cover letter, and their structured approach to their CV, they seem to have good communication skills."
further_attributes:
  match: value between 0 and 1
  reason: "etc"
</match>

And then finally, produce a summary, wrapped in a <summary></summary> tag, of the candidate's overall suitability for the job, and their overall suitability for the company.

Here is the data:

We are on a mission to map and analyse the global climate law and policy landscape
By supporting evidence-based laws and policies, our vision is to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, resilient and just world.

- We are led by a team of international climate change law and policy and machine learning experts, bridging the climate and tech worlds.
- Climate Policy Radar is built on a decade of experience leading research and resource development on global climate laws and policies at the London School of Economics and Political Science, serving policymakers, researchers and civil society worldwide.
- We believe in collaboration, not competition, and we actively seek out partners who share our ambition and values.

Our Values
Moonshot intention with grounded urgent action

We seek to bring about meaningful change towards a better future, using data effectively to make a difference to people and planet.

In particular, we want to influence and change the way evidence informs policy and investment decisions. While this is a marathon, and we’re in it for the long haul, the urgency of the challenge means we are committed to sprints and to achieving short term goals, without losing sight of our long term mission.

Excellence

We strive to be excellent at what we do and how we do it.

Holding ourselves to the highest standard of research and development, operations, management and engagement with our stakeholders.

Truth Seeking

We will be honest and act with integrity in the data we produce and the way that we communicate what it means.

We will make an active effort to avoid bias in all our practices and importantly, in the way we collect, curate and communicate data. We will be dispassionate about any given course of action as long as there is evidence to show its effectiveness - there are no silver bullets.

Transparency

We will make our data, analyses and platform available for others to use and build on.

We will be open about how we work and what we do, and explain our data and analyses clearly using language that is readily understood by our target audiences. We will be leaders in open sourcing climate data and contributing to open source efforts globally.

Learning and experimenting

We seek to continuously learn and improve ourselves and our organisation and to advance a culture of evidence-based decision making

Through constant learning from others’ successes, mistakes and through innovation and experimentation where things have not been tried before. We embrace failure, will interrogate our mistakes openly, and try and improve on our weaknesses.

Emotional intelligence

We are committed to intelligent and empathic communication with our team, stakeholders, and audiences.

We will be honest, reliable, approachable, and practice generosity and integrity in all our dealings with others, both in Climate Policy Radar and externally.

Bridge building and collaboration

We take a radical collaboration approach to our work - both internally and externally. We do not view other people and organisations as competitors, but rather as allies.

Everyone in the team will contribute their unique skills, insights and work with others to maximise synergies. We will build links with the broad climate change community, and collaborate and integrate with other climate change data providers and organisations.

Building the evidence base for evidence-based decision-making

We build tools that open up the messy black box of climate laws, policies and case law globally, helping decision-makers design more effective climate change strategies.
Use our tools to quickly and easily find information on climate laws and policies.
Open data and tools for climate policy and law research

- Explore: Search through the complete text of thousands of climate change policy and law documents from every country.
- Research: Easily find parts of documents that are relevant to what you’re looking for. Our AI tool saves time by automatically detecting and highlighting similar words.
- Analyse: Compare different nations’ climate action plans, and explore climate laws and policies by sector.

We are on a mission to map and analyse the global climate law and policy landscape to help drive the transition to a low-carbon, resilient and just world.

The need for informed climate change policymaking

Laws and policies are essential to slashing global emissions, building climate-resilient, adaptive communities and economies, and accounting for loss and damage from climate impacts.

Yet data on existing climate policies and laws are currently hard to find and analyse. Documents and data are spread across diffuse resources in different languages, in inconsistent formats. This makes it difficult to learn from successes and mistakes and to develop ambitious ways forward.

We are working to open up and make sense of that data to support informed policymaking, track progress and model policy risk. Use our open data tools for:

- Policymaking: Carry out deep dives into a wide range of areas, assess policy options and identify best practices.
- Policy tracking: Track global action and progress towards meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.
- Accountability: Assess policy choices, draw attention to insufficient action, and advocate for alternatives.
- Risk modelling: Build law and policy metrics into risk models, and gain a better understanding of the regulatory environment.

AI for climate law and policy research

We use data science and artificial intelligence to map and analyse the world's climate change policies and laws, supporting a deep understanding of what works, where, and for whom.

By turning documents into searchable, accessible and useful information, our work aims to advance global research efforts to understand the effectiveness of climate laws, policies and litigation.

- Aggregate and sort: Bringing climate policy data together from diffuse resources - from government websites to climate negotiation documents.
- Digest and analyse: Training AI algorithms to extract useful information from climate documents. This will help to pinpoint trends and highlight action gaps.
- Expose and share: Building an open knowledge graph to map this information. This will enable climate policy evaluation, analysis and modelling. And ultimately, help to guide better decision-making.

      "A few extra notes about some of the attributes:\n",
      "- education: If the company doesn't require any specific educational requirements, then the candidate's education is less important. However, if the company has a specific requirement, like a degree or diploma, the candidate's education is more important, and a suitable match ranking need to be predicted.\n",

If the candidate has the exact required skills, the harmony can be scored 1.0, and the conflict score can be very low or 0.0. If a candidate has adjacent skills that are quite similar to the required skills, the match can be ranked lower than 1.0, but still highly. If the candidate has no relevant skills, the match can be ranked lower.\n",
      "- experience: Pay special attention to whether the company explicitly requires experience in any specific industries, technologies, or tools, and rank accordingly. However, if the company is not specific about the required experience, and the candidate doesn't have a lot of experience, then other factors can be taken into account to support a candidate's experience, like the candidate's side-projects, hobbies, or similar activities.\n",
      "- culture fit: Make sure to explicitly consider whether the candidate's stated hobbies, interests or other personal details potentially conflict with the core mission, values and focus areas of the company. Evaluate both alignment and potential misalignment.\n",

      "Please give detailed reasons for your scores for each of the attributes. Note that harmony and conflict isn't mutually exclusive, and a candidate can have both high harmony and conflict for the same attribute. For instance, a candidate might have a high harmony score for culture fit, because they're educated on a postgraduate level just like the company founders, but they might also have a high conflict score for culture fit, because they partake in a hobby which might be at odds with the company's mission and values, like hunting animals whereas the company operates in animal welfare.\n",

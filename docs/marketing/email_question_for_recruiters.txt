Hi <NAME>,

How are you?

As you were so communicative in our previous interactions, I thought I'd reach out with some questions I had about job hunting, if you don't mind.

I read a bunch of articles like these: https://blog.jobheron.co.uk/6-hiring-challenges-businesses-face-and-how-to-overcome-them/

And wanted to get your opinion on hiring challenges. It seems like the big 3 problems are:
- Attracting the wrong applicants (Understandably, job seekers can get desperate for any job, and apply a shotgun approach to finding a job)
- Hiring takes a long time (I'm been on both sides of this, but I was wondering what percentage of the process is taken up by filtering CVs, reading cover letters, and trying to establish culture fit)
- Poor candidate experience (As you know, I like communicative recruiters, and then usually we're just rejected with a bland templatised email, whereas a bit of feedback would be great.)

Do you agree that these are challenges?
What are your (as agent/recruiter) biggest challenges?
What percentage of the process is taken up by filtering CVs, reading cover letters, and trying to establish culture fit?
Do you or companies use any tools or software to help with the above (filtering CVs, reading cover letters, and trying to establish culture fit)?
If your answers are different for permanent roles and freelance/contracts, please specify.

Thank you, and I know this is a lot to put on your plate, but I'm looking at building an AI-powered tool which will help companies find the right candidates, but just want to get a lay of the land first.

Please do share this with your colleagues if you think they can add some insight/perspective.

Kind regards,
Juan

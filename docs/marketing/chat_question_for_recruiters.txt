Hi NAME, how are you? Just a quick(ish) question: what are the biggest challenges companies/recruiters face when trying to find the right candidates?  I was also wondering how much time is spent on filtering CVs, reading cover letters, and trying to establish culture fit, and if you use any tools/software to help with this.
